That horrifying, outdated, dilapidated and tiresome old design is gone.

The eternal joke about redesigning my site has stopped! At least for now… let’s see how this iteration of my site goes eh?

Now, anyone that knows me, knows I “do WordPress” for a living.  
I‘ve unashamedly become the dreaded “WordPress Developer”, you know, instead of a “proper developer”.

So…

## Why doesn’t it look like Wordress?

Because it’s not.

You see, WordPress is almost my whole day 5-7 days a week.

I need a break from it. I miss grass-roots development and designing a site without worrying about what WordPress is going to do with it.

Tinkering. Reading. Learning.  
These are all the things I’ve fallen out of the habit of doing, and I miss it.

There was a point at which I was “bleeding edge”.  
I was “up there” with the best of ‘em, learning all the stuff that browsers didn’t support.

As time has gone by I’ve gained more responsibility (both in work and life).  
I’ve let the industry overtake me a little, and I’ve lost the enthusiasm I had for learning.  

Hell, there ~~are~~ were days where I’d long to buy a log cabin in the arsehole of nowhere and live the simple life.  
I’d be rubbish at it, mind. Splinters are a real danger you see. Besides, hunger would finish me off, because I‘ve no idea how to gut an animal and I‘d no doubt eat the wrong berries… but it’s what I felt I wanted.

## Shut up you jabbering, old bellend

Anyway, the new year rolled round, and like every other self-professed “New Me” on the planet I promised this year was the year I pulled my finger out.

Time to get back to learning new things. Time to try something new (to me).

Enter Jekyll - the static site generation tool that means I can write blog posts in markdown, and publish static files to the web again.  
No more database errors, hacked forms, brute force attacks or conflicting plugins – Just plain ‘ol HTML, CSS and JS.

That’s right, I’ve gone all 1980s-1990s!  
Retro is new again right?

In fact, it’s not just the site that’s been changed.  
I’ve even gotten rid of my hosting expense by using Github Pages.  
That means if the site is down, you can blame Github, not me. Woohoo.

I guess we see where this new little adventure takes the site.  
Hope it encourages me to keep up blogging and producing new content/tweaks/experiments on my *own* site instead of just in the day job.

Onwards, upwards, inwards and round about.  
Captain Red Beard, out.
