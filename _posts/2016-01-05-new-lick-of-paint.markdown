2016 is finally here, and it's time for the procrastination to cease!

You see, it's been an ongoing joke for a while now, my site.

It's rotting, dilapidated and ageing facade has crumbled away; It's walls knocked through by a digital wrecking ball.

In it's place, a new, glistening, tall and towering spectacle has arisen.

## What have you been smoking Kersley?

Nothing. I’m proud to say I’ve never even tried a cigarette.

I do have a different issue though – I’ve let the web industry speed ahead, and now I’ve got to play catchup.

You see, I love my job – and I’m not ashamed to admit I’m now considered a “WordPress Designer & Developer”.

WordPress Themes are my bag. It’s what I do now.

The problem with this, is you get in a bubble of doing nothing but WordPress. Every job that comes in, WordPress can handle.

This poses a problem for me personally though.
I miss grass roots development.
I miss getting my hands filthy with new tech.
I miss learning.

Thats the biggest issue – the learning.
I stopped. I gave up… Excuse after excuse as to how little time I have to learn new stuff.
It’s a lie.

## Why the new site?

Well, putting it frankly, I was ashamed.

I’d not touched it in years, despite the last blog post I remember writing being about uploading a shit site in order to shame me into continuing development on it (yeah, that worked – not).

2016 has come round, and I’ve found enough _want_ to change.
I *want* to learn new stuff. I **want** to enjoy the web as much as I did.

It’s time to break away from WordPress! At least for my own sanity on my own website. Break away from the security issues, the bloat, the constant updating of plugins and the core.

## So what’s this bad boy running on?

Jekyll.

Never having played with Jekyll, and the benefits of it directly opposing everything I dislike about WordPress, it’s time to get my hands dirty again.

Static sites are all the rage now right?

No database lookups, no PHP script vulnerabilities, no issues with versions of things breaking other things.

Just. Static. Files.

**HUZZAH**

Let’s see how it goes – and _please_, if you spot something wrong, let me know on Twitter – I’m being anal about everything on the new site as a mechanism to stop avoiding the awkward and difficult side of the web.

Ginger Beard Out!
